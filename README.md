# Learning TypeScript
 
This is my introduction to TypeScript for web design. I have previously learned JavaScript in the context of creating web applications and services. 

---

## Background
I started coding with Python and Java in an object oriented approach, meaning JavaScript's halfway attempt at... well everything scared me. I especially found issues with the way that the langauge handled (or didn't handle) types. After an entire course in JavaScript, and lots of hiccups surrounding langauge specific adjustments, I wanted a better solution that I could quickly pick up, which led me here! 

## Outline
I'm beginning my foray by using TypeScript's online handbook located [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/). My goal is to pick up this language to fill the void that JavaScript left in my heart - not because it left, but because it hurt me so. Once I work my way through the handbook, I will go onto other resources until I feel comfortable enough to begin on exercises and projects (I don't think this will take me long thanks to my JS experience). 
Let's see what this has in store!

### Folders
1. Notes
    - Contains the notes that I have taken (in code and text format) from the TypeScript handbook online (see link above).
2. Exercises
    - Any additional code segments or programs that are designed beyond the scope of the handbook, but still guided by something.
3. Projects
    - Projects that go beyond simply a guided exercise. Will include the beginning attemtps at making websites for personal use.
